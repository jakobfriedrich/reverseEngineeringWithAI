================================================

Run ID: 002
Model: Claude-Sonnet-4
Timestamp: 2025-11-06T14:32:00Z
Output Directory: ./out_002_Claude-Sonnet-4

Tools/Packages Used:
- js-beautify@1.15.4 (already installed)
- espree@9.6.1 (newly installed)
- acorn@8.10.0 (newly installed)
- acorn-walk@3.2.0 (newly installed)
- ajv-cli@5.0.0 (globally installed)

File Counts:
- Original JS files: 3
- Beautified files: 3 (100% success rate, pre-existing)
- Total chunks analyzed: 3
- No Service Worker (content script only extension)
- Content scripts: 2 files (content.js, set-json-global.js)
- UI files: 2 files (options/options.html, options/options.js)

Analysis Results:
- Chrome API calls found: 3 unique calls
- Event listeners: 2
- Message channels: 0
- Storage keys: 1
- Network endpoints: 0 unique domains
- Workflows identified: 4
- Privacy risks: 0 medium/high severity

Beautification:
- Success: 3 files (pre-existing beautified versions)
- Errors: 0 files
- Files excluded: node_modules (54 files), out_001_GPT-4.1

Code Analysis Challenges:
- All JS files heavily obfuscated/minified
- Analysis based on string literals and observable patterns
- Limited AST parsing due to obfuscation
- Relied on manifest inspection and string table analysis

Validation:
- honey_summary.json: PASSED schema validation
- outline.jsonl: 3 entries (all chunks covered)
- analysis_notes.md: Complete, all chunks documented
- CSV files: endpoints.csv (0 rows), messages.csv (0 rows), storage_keys.csv (1 row)

Extension Characteristics:
- Type: Content script only (no background worker)
- Purpose: JSON formatting for web pages
- Data collection: Minimal (theme preference only)
- Network activity: None detected
- Risk level: Very low

Known Gaps/Unknowns:
- Detailed code flow obscured by obfuscation
- Exact API usage patterns unclear due to minification
- Open source claims not verified against distributed version

Completion Status: SUCCESS
